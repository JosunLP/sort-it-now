Copyright (c) 2025 Jonas Pfalzgraf / JosunLP

This license allows non-commercial use of the Software. Any commercial use
requires the Licensor’s prior written permission. This is a source-available
license and is not an OSI-approved open-source license.

## 1. Definitions

1.1 “Software” means the source code, object code, scripts, configuration files,
documentation, and any other materials included in this repository or otherwise
distributed with this license.

1.2 “Use” means to run, reproduce, display, test, modify, create derivative
works of, merge, distribute, or make available as a service.

1.3 “Non-Commercial Purposes” are purposes that are not intended to obtain a
commercial advantage or monetary compensation, whether direct or indirect.
Examples include research, teaching, personal/hobby projects, and internal
evaluation. Mere cost recovery without a profit motive is treated as
non-commercial.

1.4 “Commercial Use” includes, without limitation: offering paid products or
services; use within for-profit business models; providing or incorporating the
Software into paid, ad-supported, or monetized offerings; use to deliver paid
services or consulting; or use in production systems of an entity pursuing
profit. In cases of doubt, the use is deemed Commercial unless the Licensor
provides written permission.

1.5 “Licensor” means Jonas Pfalzgraf. “Licensee” means any person or entity that
uses the Software.

and is prohibited for Commercial Use absent written permission under Section 3.

Software will be error-free, uninterrupted, secure, or meet the Licensee’s
requirements.

all responsibility and liability for any and all claims, losses, damages,

Software or this License, including but not limited to loss of profits, revenue,
data, goodwill, business interruption, procurement of substitute goods or
services, failure of security mechanisms, or any other commercial or economic
loss, in each case whether based on contract, tort (including negligence),
strict liability, or any other theory, even if advised of the possibility of
such damages and even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose.

8.3 The Licensee assumes all risks and responsibilities for selection, Use, and
results obtained from the Software.

warranties or liabilities; in such cases, the exclusions and limitations above
